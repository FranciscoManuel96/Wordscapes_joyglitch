# Wordscapes_joyglitch
 
I started by creating the project on UnityHub, using the 2D Mobile template.
Then I created the repository on the GitHub Desktop app with the gitignore for Unity.
(I know this steps should be done in the opposite order but I was so focused in starting the project I forgot to setup the repo first.)

When I did my first committ the project already had some things in it. Like Portrait mode forced on application use (so it always runs on vertical), canvas and some elements of it (background and placeholders for score, level and dragging area).
